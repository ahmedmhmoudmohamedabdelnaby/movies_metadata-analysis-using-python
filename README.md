Genres: The movie genres (e.g., Animation, Comedy, Family).
Homepage: Link to the movie's official webpage.
ID: The unique ID for each movie.
IMDB ID: The IMDB identification number.
Original Language: The original language of the movie.
Original Title: The original title of the movie.
Overview: A brief summary of the movie plot.
Popularity: The popularity score of the movie.
Poster Path: Path to the movie poster image.
Production Companies: The companies involved in the production of the movie.
Production Countries: Countries involved in the production of the movie.

Python Analysis
For the analysis, I utilized Python and its powerful libraries to process, visualize, and analyze the data:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Managed missing values and standardized columns.
Converted necessary columns to appropriate data types (e.g., date, numerical).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined distribution of movie genres, budgets, and revenue.
Analyzed the correlation between movie revenue and popularity.
Investigated trends over time in movie releases.
Data Visualization:

Seaborn: Used Seaborn to create heatmaps, box plots, and bar charts to better understand relationships and distributions in the dataset.
Matplotlib: Utilized Matplotlib for detailed custom visualizations to represent trends, revenue, and ratings over time.
Pandas: Leveraged Pandas for efficient data manipulation, including grouping data by genre, release year, and more.
Insights:

Analyzed the popularity and revenue patterns in the movie industry.
Investigated the relationship between the movie budget and its box-office revenue.
Explored trends in movie production countries and genres over the years.
Project Outcome
By using Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas, I was able to uncover key insights about the movie industry, visualizing and analyzing data trends to make data-driven conclusions. This analysis can be extended to other datasets or used to predict potential success factors for new movies.
